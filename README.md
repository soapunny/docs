# docs

A personal documentation repository for programming study notes: concepts, syntax, book summaries, and curated references.

**Focus:** read → write → reference  
**Goal:** keep notes easy to revisit and searchable.

## How to Use

- Use GitHub search:
  - `repo:soapunny/docs <keyword>`
  - Examples: `repo:soapunny/docs normalization`, `repo:soapunny/docs OOP`

## Writing Guidelines

To keep notes consistent:

- Begin each doc with a short **TL;DR** (3–5 bullets).
- Prefer this flow: **Problem → Concept → Example → Gotchas → References**
- Keep examples minimal and runnable when possible.
- Add sources at the bottom as links (official docs preferred).
